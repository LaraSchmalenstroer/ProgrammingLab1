    "### Ex. 2 (7 pts) Eight queens\n",
    "#### The game of chess is played on a checkered board consisting of 64 squares arranged on an 8 by 8 grid. Different types of pieces are placed on the board, each of which is allowed different types of moves. A piece can capture another piece (which is subsequently removed from the board) if it can move to the square occupied by the other piece in a single turn. Here, we are not really interested in the rules of the game, instead, we are only interested in the movements of the piece called queen. The queen is the most powerful piece in chess, it can move along the board in any direction, horizontally, vertically one or more squares. Thus any other piece placed in a straight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line (with no intervening pieces) can be captured by the queen. The \"eight queens\" problem asks you to place as many queens as possible on a chessboard so that no queen can capture any other queen. (Note, that there cannot be more than 8 queens on an 8 by 8 chessboard, as this requires at least one row and column to contain more than one queen, each of which would be able to capture the other.)\n",
    "##### (a) (4 pts) Write a program that finds and prints a solution for the eight queens problem, placing eight queens on the board in such a way that no queen can capture any other. (In chess, columns are labeled a to h (left to right) and rows 1 to 8 (bottom to top). You can print the positions as a1, b5, c3, . . . for the eight queens.)\n",
    "##### Hint: Note, that there has to be exactly one queen in each of the columns. Thus, you can represent the positions of n queens by a list/tuple of n numbers. The first number indicates the row for the queen in column a, the second indicates the row for the queen in column b, and so on."

I wanted to order the input list in descending order and check for each word if the words with its length - 1 are valid children, such that their longest common substring is exactly the shorter word. Then I wanted to work with a queue-like datastructure and add the valid children to to be checked next. But then I didnt't know how to proceed and how to save the results in order to be able to access them in the following steps. I'd be very happy if you could give me some hints if this approach could possibly work. \n",
